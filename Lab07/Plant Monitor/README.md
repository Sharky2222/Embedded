DATE: 12/6/2021

AUTHORS: Nikolas Figueroa, Sanjay Thallam, Joseph Verdade

Overview: 	

	The moisture sensor and light sensor's data that was processed in the MSP430 is sent to the C# 
	application to be displayed in a GUI. This code also sends the data that was processed in the 
	GUI to ThingSpeak to be graphically displayed on the website. This ties the IOT project together.
